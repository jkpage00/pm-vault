# Obsidian Product Management Vault

This is a starter vault that provides the configurations, folder structure, templates, plugins, and key files and workflows that I have evolved for Product Management work

This Obsidian setup is my attempt to satisfy the following objectives:
- Low-friction capture of ideas, tasks, projects, customers, meeting notes, updates and accomplishments, etc
- Low-friction processing of captured tasks and information to facilitate surfacing relevant notes and data in context
- Heavy use of properties, links, tags, templates, and queries to flexibly organize and surface key information and tasks
- A central launch pad (Home note) for core product management activities
- Integrations with Apple shortcuts for automation
- Judicious use of plug-ins, focusing on genuine value-add and wide usage

## Configuration

## Folder structure

The folder structure is based on Nick Milo's ACE system:

- \+ (inbox for random and/or temporary notes that don't obviously fit into one of the main categories)
- Atlas (knowledge management)
- Calendar (dated logs meeting notes)
- Efforts (project and task management)

I also include Systems folder which contains templates, attachments, and other meta files and notes to document and support my workflows
